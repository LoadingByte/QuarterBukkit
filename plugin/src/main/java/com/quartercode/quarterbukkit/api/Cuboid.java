/**
 * <p>
 * This class represents a cuboid between to different locations saved as {@link Vector}s.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The cuboid can't get modified after construction, so it's final. You can only read values in different ways.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All constructors delivers their cooridnates to {@link #Cuboid(double, double, double, double, double, double)} which sorts them to a larger and a smaller {@link Vector}. This will lose the original
 * locations, but you can work better with the data later on.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link #getVector1()} returns the larger one, {@link #getVector2()} the smaller one. You can also read those values by using the {@code getXXX1()} and {@code getXXX2()} methods.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here's an example how the sorting works: We have two locations with the coordinates {@code 5, 10, 7} and {@code 12, 6, 18}, the {@link Vector}s will be the larger one {@code 12, 10, 18} and the
 * smaller one {@code 5, 6, 7}.
